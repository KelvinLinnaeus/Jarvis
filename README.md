# Jarvis

Jarvis is a virtual assistant built in Python inspired by Tony Stark's assistant in the Iron Man movies.

## Features

- Voice recognition and synthesis
- Natural language processing for understanding commands
- Task automation
- Customizable plugins for extending functionality

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition library
- pyttsx3 library
- nltk library (for natural language processing)
- Any additional libraries required by specific plugins

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KelvinMhacwilson/Jarvis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd jarvis
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run Jarvis:

   ```bash
   python jarvis.py
   ```

4. Jarvis will start listening for commands. Say "Jarvis" followed by your command to interact with it.

## Configuration

You can configure Jarvis by editing the `config.py` file. This file contains settings such as the wake word, voice recognition and synthesis settings, and plugin configurations.

## Extending Functionality

You can extend Jarvis's functionality by creating custom plugins. Plugins are Python modules that define functions to handle specific commands. Place your plugin files in the `plugins` directory. Check the existing plugins for examples on how to create your own.
